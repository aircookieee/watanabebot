It's a dumb Discord bot I made as a meme that somehow people want to add.

Responds "Watashi?" if someone accidentally summons You Watanabe from Love Live! Sunshine!!

# Usage
Will automatically respond to summons in all channels by default.

You can set the bot to only respond in a certain channel by saying `!yousoro here` in the channel. Say `!yousoro everywhere` to have the bot respond in all channels again.

*NOTE: If you don't have the Administrator permission, these commands will not work and You will not be happy. Invalid commands will also make You unhappy.*

Type `!yousoro` for the list of commands.

# Installation
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Pull the repository
3. Create a [Discord application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
4. Create a bot from the left sidebar
5. Put your token in `auth.json`
6. Run `npm install discord.js hammerandchisel/erlpack fs`
7. Run `node bot.js`
